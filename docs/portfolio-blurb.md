# Servible — Portfolio Entry

## Servible

**AI-native business management platform for service providers**

Servible is a full-stack SaaS platform that consolidates CRM, scheduling, invoicing, project management, and a website builder into a single workspace — with AI deeply integrated into every workflow.

### The Problem
Service businesses juggle 5-10 disconnected tools to run their operations: a CRM, a scheduling tool, invoicing software, a project manager, a website builder, a file manager. Context is scattered, workflows are manual, and nothing talks to anything else.

### The Solution
One platform where a freelancer, agency, or consultant manages their entire business. An AI assistant that doesn't just answer questions but actually creates clients, logs time, generates invoices, and builds websites from natural language. A client portal where customers self-serve on projects, invoices, and bookings.

### Key Technical Highlights
- **AI-powered site builder** — describe your business, get a complete multi-page website with design tokens, copy, and imagery
- **Conversational AI with tool-use** — Claude-powered chat assistant that reads and writes the database in real-time (create clients, log time, generate invoices)
- **14-type block editor** with natural language editing — change any section of your site by chatting with it
- **AI file analysis** — vision-based image tagging, document summarization, semantic search
- **Passwordless client portal** — magic link auth, self-service dashboard for projects, invoices, files, and bookings
- **Full financial suite** — quotes with optional items, digital contracts with e-signatures, invoicing with EU tax types and Stripe payments
- **Multi-locale** (nl/en/de/fr) — AI output respects organization language and brand voice
