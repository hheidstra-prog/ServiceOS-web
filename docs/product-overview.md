# Servible — Product Overview

## What is Servible?

Servible is an AI-native business management platform for service providers — freelancers, agencies, consultants, and small service businesses. It replaces the stack of disconnected tools (CRM, scheduling, invoicing, project management, website builder) with a single, intelligent platform where AI is woven into every workflow.

Each business gets their own branded workspace with a public-facing website, client portal, and booking system — all managed from one dashboard.

**Target audience:** European service businesses (freelancers, agencies, consultants, coaches, creative professionals). Default locale Dutch/EU, with full nl/en/de/fr support.

## Core Features

### AI Assistant
A conversational AI chat powered by Claude that can actually *do* things — not just answer questions. It creates clients, logs time, generates invoices, searches your data, and provides business summaries. Up to 5 tool-use iterations per request, fully locale-aware, with your brand voice and business context injected into every interaction.

### CRM / Client Management
Full client lifecycle from lead to paid. Pipeline status tracking (Lead → Quote Sent → Contract Signed → Active → Invoiced → Paid → Archived), multiple contacts per client, tagging, notes, and a complete activity timeline. Each client detail page shows projects, quotes, invoices, files, and all interactions in one place.

### Projects & Tasks
Project management tied to clients with status tracking, budget management (monetary + hour budgets), task lists with priorities and due dates, file attachments, and time entry association. Progress bars show task completion at a glance.

### Booking & Scheduling
Configurable booking types with duration, pricing, buffer times, and custom intake questions. Per-day availability rules. Public booking page for new leads, plus a portal-specific flow for existing clients (with access to non-public booking types like paid sessions). Calendar view in admin. Creates full audit trail (Client + Contact + Booking + Event + Notification).

### Time Tracking
Log time entries with client/project association, billable/non-billable split, and per-entry hourly rates. Period summaries (today, week, month). Convert tracked time directly into invoices.

### Quotes
Auto-numbered proposals (QUO-YYYY-NNNN) with line items, optional items clients can select/deselect, and tax handling. Full lifecycle tracking (Draft → Sent → Viewed → Accepted/Rejected/Expired). Public access via unique URL. Reminder tracking. Can convert to contracts.

### Contracts
Digital contracts with electronic signature capture (name, timestamp, IP). Lifecycle from draft through signed. Public signing page via access token. Can be linked to quotes for a seamless sales flow.

### Invoices
Professional invoicing with auto-numbering (INV-YYYY-NNNN), line items with EU tax types (standard, reduced, zero, exempt, reverse charge), partial payments, credit notes, and Stripe payment integration (iDEAL, card, SEPA, Bancontact, bank transfer, cash). Overdue detection with dashboard alerts. Public invoice view.

### Services Catalog
Reusable service definitions with flexible pricing (fixed, hourly, daily, monthly, custom), tax rates, and custom units. Used as templates when creating quotes and invoices.

### Website Builder (AI-Powered)
Describe your business and get a complete, multi-page website generated by AI — pages, blocks, design tokens, copy, color scheme, typography. 14 block types (hero, features, services, testimonials, CTA, contact, FAQ, pricing, stats, process, logos, columns, text, image). Edit any block through natural language chat. AI image search pulls from your media library and Freepik stock. Full design token system with templates (starter, agency, consultant), light/dark modes, and custom domains.

### Blog / CMS (AI-Powered)
Chat-driven blog management — describe the post you want, and AI generates full rich-text content. TipTap/Novel editor with AI title/excerpt regeneration, AI SEO metadata generation, inline AI content editing, and AI image suggestions. Category/tag taxonomy, scheduling, and multi-site publication (one post, multiple sites with different slugs). Public blog with category filters, table of contents, related posts, and booking CTA.

### File Management (AI-Powered)
Cloudinary-backed media library with AI analysis on upload — images get AI-generated descriptions and tags via Claude vision; documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV) get text extraction and summarization. Semantic search expands your query using AI before searching. Chat-driven interface. Freepik stock image integration. Files associate with clients and projects.

### Client Portal
White-labelled, passwordless self-service portal for your clients. Magic link login (32-byte token, 24h expiry). Clients see their projects (with task progress), invoices (pending/paid), files (grouped by project, with download), and bookings (upcoming/past). Dark/light theme toggle. Portal booking flow gives clients access to all booking types including non-public ones.

### Inbox / Notifications
Internal notification center receiving system alerts — new bookings, form submissions, and other events. Links to source entities for quick action.
