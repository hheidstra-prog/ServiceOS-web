# Project Instructions

## Screenshots
When the user says "see screenshot" or references a screenshot, always check the `screenshots/` folder in the project root for the latest files. Do not ask for a file path.

## Language
The application supports multiple locales (nl, en, de, fr). AI-powered features must respect the organization's locale setting. Use `getBusinessContext()` or `getOrganizationContext()` to retrieve the locale and include appropriate language instructions in AI system prompts.
